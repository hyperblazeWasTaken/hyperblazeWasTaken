Hi I am Timi a motivated and versatile student pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. With a robust foundation in full-stack web development, I specialize in building dynamic and scalable web applications using cutting-edge technologies like React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and various component libraries such as DaisyUI and ShadcnUI. My experience extends to backend development with Prisma, Supabase, and NeonDB, as well as authentication solutions with NextAuth, and deployment expertise on Vercel.

Beyond web development, I bring hands-on experience in IT support, proficient in managing and troubleshooting across multiple platforms, including Jamf Now for Apple device management, Windows, Android, and VMware Player for virtualization.

Additionally, I possess strong data analysis skills, leveraging tools like Excel, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy) to derive insights and drive decision-making. My diverse skill set and practical experience equip me to deliver comprehensive technical solutions that meet both business and individual needs.
